							<h3>Keynote Speaker</h3>
							<p>Trala's mission is to make world-class music education accessible to every single person on Earth. Our first product, Trala: Learn Violin is an app that teaches anyone how to play violin. We have had over 250,000 downloads and raised $4.9M to-date since launch in 2017. The story of Trala began at 54.io, when I met my future co-founder Vish Indukuri while people were forming teams. We teamed up, built something cool, and liked the experience so much we decided to keep working together. Three years and many other hackathons later, we started Trala together. We've had many ups and downs since launch, but the support along the way has been incredible. From participating in Cozad and iVenture to going through Techstars and raising our seed round, it's been a constantly rewarding experience. And it all started at 54!</p>
