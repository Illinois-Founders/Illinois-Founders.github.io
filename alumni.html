                            <p>Last week we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrasto/">Matt Rastovac</a>, previous co-president of Founders (2018), who is now residing in Oakland, California to see how his entrepreneurial endeavors are going.

                                Matt is now working on his startup, <a href="https://buildatmos.com/">Atmos</a>, which lets users build personalized houses from the ground up. We can’t wait to see what he and the team will accomplish next. 
                            </p>
                            <em>The following has been lightly edited for clarity. </em>
                            <br></br>
                            <p><strong>Founders: Can you tell us about yourself?</strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: I began coding when I was 13. My first project was a cryptocurrency exchange, because that’s what  I found really interesting. I came to UIUC in DGS and wanted to get into Computer Science. I knew that the acceptance rate was 2%, and my main goal was to get a job at Facebook. I ended up getting straight A’s freshman year and got into CS. I got rejected by lots of companies when applying for internships sophomore year. I had an offer from a company in Research Park that didn’t excite me so I didn’t take it, and then during May I got a sudden text from NASA asking if I still wanted to intern there, and that’s where I worked as a data science intern which was instrumental in applying my machine learning skills. Then I ran 54 when Founders only had 4-5 people with Shivani. The next year Bryan Sun and I became co-presidents of Founders, and it was in 2018 that we started Forge. Over the course of that semester I remember intending to get coffee with 30 people, and eventually it ended up becoming 130 people! Then the last semester of college, I took a co-op with a Chicago startup called Cameo which then turned into a full-time job for which I dropped out of school. My friend from Facebook had a VR/AR startup in the bay area and I flew out on a whim to go meet him for one week, and I’ve been here ever since.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Founders: What is your proudest accomplishment?</strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: In my time we went from working with 10 entrepreneurs to 100 plus startups on campus. I think the other proudest moment I had was getting Forge off the ground. That moment when I walked into the Technexus space for the introduction, and seeing all the Midwest entrepreneurs in one space, that was a special moment. </p>
                            <p><strong>Founders: What are some key lessons that you learned from internal or external Founders connections? This could be from mentors, entrepreneurs, or even friends.</strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: I still keep in touch with Manu, the director of iVenture. There’s a lot of Founders members and entrepreneurs that I still keep in touch with, and the connections I made were invaluable.</p>
                            <p><strong>Founders: Do you have any advice that you want to give to current Founders members?
                            </strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: During my time here, I noticed how different entrepreneurs from different schools were. Every founder from Atmos dropped out of school, and we work all day everyday. Location is also a huge factor in success. If you want to succeed in a software startup, the Valley is the place. If you do a student startup it will teach you many things, but only if you put in the effort. You need to go into the startup with the mindset of your back against the wall, like you don’t have the fallback of school. That’s how you’ll see the most success.</p>
                            <p><strong>Founders: How did you specifically find investors for Atmos?</strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: Before I joined, Atmos already had two early stage investors. They didn’t even invest in the idea, they invested in the person that was involved, Nicholas Donahue, and that’s the best way to invest. Sam Altman also really liked Nick as an individual who thought about the higher level concepts. He liked the way Nick thought about things, and decided to invest in Atmos.</p>
                            <p><strong>Founders: Were there moments between Cameo and funding that you were worried about money?</strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: Not me, but my co-founders did. There were months when they had to work in co-working environments with other startups working side by side. We slowly upgraded to our own office and have grown the team to 8 full-time employees. </p>
                            <p><strong>Founders: What does your day to day look like? How does that compare to working at a big company?</strong></p>
                            <p>Matt: If you’re going to work at a big company, then you’ll have a defined schedule and are less motivated to work during off-hours. You don’t have any skin in the game and you’re complacent. Whereas at Atmos, it feels like you’re always thinking about it and you constantly have to prioritize what to do. I was paid more as an intern at Facebook than I ever have been anywhere, but I couldn’t stay complacent.</p>

                            <p>Last month’s edition focused on one of Founder’s signature events: 54. This month we’ll shift the attention to Forge, our annual event in Chicago that brings together students to participate in the largest run student startup weekend in the midwest! We'll be meeting Amogh Ayalasomayajula, one of this year's co-directors for Forge.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <p>Amogh recently completed his freshman year studying computer science and statistics. He is exploring the various areas of computer science and has so far expressed interest in machine learning. He is currently working on a predictive maintenance algorithm project for Panasonic in addition to being part of the microgrants team at Founders. On microgrants, Amogh enjoys interacting with various startups and determining how the microgrants team can help them achieve their goals. As a co-director for Forge in 2020, he is responsible for coordinating the event and making sure it runs smoothly. </p>
                            <p>We learned from Amogh that the co-directors are treating all the planning for Forge as if it were going to be held as an online event. They began doing so after the university’s computer science department announced that classes will be held online during the fall semester. One of the positive effects of transitioning the event online will be the decreased commitment needed from the mentors, speakers and judges who make the event a memorable and valuable experience for participants. Instead of requiring guests to come in person to the TechNexus space in Chicago, they can now fulfill their role from the comfort of their homes by sparing a few hours of their time. According to Amogh, this may help bring in “bigger contacts” that had previously expressed interest in attending Forge but were reluctant because of the commitment.
                            </p>
                            <p>Amogh also discussed the possibility of implementing a new idea in this year's Forge that creates a second track increasing the event’s accessibility. Traditionally, Forge has had a competitive application that only accepted teams that passed a selection process. A goal for Forge this year is to keep this “main track” of teams highly competitive, but to introduce a second track for teams that may not be as far along in their progress. This second track would also allow individuals who aren’t a part of a startup to join a team or create a new team with other students. Thankfully, going online would alleviate many of the problems that adding this second track would normally create. Without needing to worry about increasing the amount of food, space or event coordinators to accommodate these new guests in person, Forge online will be the perfect environment to test out this new program. </p>
                            <p>The main challenge that Amogh addressed was the absence of the human interaction that normally makes Forge a great networking event and opportunity to create new friendships. Fortunately, he plans to use tools such as Zoom’s breakout room feature to simulate small groups and deliver the best possible experience to participants. We are confident that this year’s Forge will be a smashing success in the hands of our talented co-directors, in spite of their challenging circumstances. </p>
