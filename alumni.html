                            <p>Derek has been integral in kickstarting the Founders alumni engagement initiative. He formulated the ideas for our first newsletter, conducted the first alumni interviews and is largely responsible for developing the growing relationship between Founders and its alumni. In this edition, we are excited to announce that Derek recently graduated UIUC with a degree in Systems Engineering* and is now a Founders alum himself! </p>
                            <p>Derek joined Founders as a Senior, but his experience with the organization began as a sophomore when he participated in 54. During the event, he created a startup that eventually joined Jump Capital’s incubator program and received $35,000 in funding! He joined Founders to continue his involvement with entrepreneurship on campus and enter a community of like-minded students. As a member of the recently formed partnerships team, he was responsible for outreach, managing relationships and representing Founders.</p>
                            <p>During the summer, Derek planned to work in Washington D.C. on an assignment to modernize the technology of a federal bureau. The opportunity was canceled due to COVID-19, but Derek was able work on the project remotely instead. He is currently working as a consultant analyzing voter data and making campaign recommendations in swing states. He’s also searching and interviewing for full-time positions, ideally in product management or software engineering. Interviewing for positions virtually can be challenging, especially during tough economic times. We want to wish him the best of luck and thank him for all of his hard work!</p>
                            <p>Thanks Derek for all your incredible work with Founders and the Alumni Engagment team!
